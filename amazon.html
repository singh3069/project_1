                The Amazon rainforest, covering much of northwestern Brazil and extending into Colombia, Peru and other South American countries, 
                is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, famed for its biodiversity. It’s crisscrossed by thousands of rivers, including the 
                powerful Amazon. River towns, with 19th-century architecture from rubber-boom days, include Brazil’s Manaus and Belém and Peru’s 
                Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado.

            The rainforest’s endless diversity of plants and animals encompasses thousands of species, including mammals, such as monkeys and jaguars, 
            birds, reptiles and marine life. Ecotourism lodges offer boat trips, fishing excursions and jungle hikes with local guides, and visits to 
            the traditional villages of some of the region’s hundreds of indigenous tribes. The annual Boi-Bumbá festival, on the Amazon River island 
            city of Parintins in Brazil, brings outlandish costumes, singing and parade floats. The region’s food specialties include ground cassava, 
            açaí juice and pirarucu, a huge river fish.
