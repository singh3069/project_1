                Queenstown, New Zealand, sits on the shores of the South Island’s Lake Wakatipu, set against the dramatic Southern Alps. 
                Renowned for adventure sports, it’s also a base for exploring the region’s vineyards and historic mining towns. There's 
                bungee jumping off Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge and jet-boating on the Shotover and Dart rivers. In winter, there's skiing 
                on the slopes of The Remarkables and Coronet Peak.

                The Skyline Gondola carries passengers to Bob’s Peak for views of the mountains and Lake Wakatipu. The Queenstown Trail is a 
                cycle path following lakes, rivers and vineyards, while the Routeburn Track is a high mountain hike heading into the glacial 
                landscapes of Fiordland. In Queenstown, visitors cruise the lake aboard the coal-fired TSS Earnslaw steamship, or take scenic
                 helicopter flights. In nearby Arrowtown, the Lakes District Museum examines the region's 19th-century gold rush. Excursions from 
                 Queenstown also include the 300km road trip to Milford Sound, a steep-sided fjord with boat cruises and kayaking.
