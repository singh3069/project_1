            Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest with terrain spanning the snow-capped Cascade Mountains to forested islands in Puget Sound. 
            Its largest city, Seattle, is known for its thriving tech industry, vibrant music scene and famed coffeehouses. 
            Its landmarks include the futuristic Space Needle, century-old Pike Place Market and Seattle Aquarium. 
            Innovative glass art is displayed at Chihuly Garden & Glass.

            To the west, hiking trails wind through vast rainforest in Olympic National Park. To the east, the 14,410-ft. volcano Mount Rainier towers 
            over the surrounding Mount Rainier National Park. Farther inland are the popular Walla Walla wine region and the city of Spokane, where 
            the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture honors the regionâ€™s Native American heritage. The state capital, Olympia, the Victorian-era town Port Townsend, 
            and the city of Tacoma, known for its Museum of Glass, are all along the coast. Offshore, the San Juan Islands is a sprawling archipelago popular for whale-watching and kayaking.
