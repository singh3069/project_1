            Alaska, northwest of Canada, is the largest and most sparsely populated U.S. state. 
            It's known for its diverse terrain of open spaces, mountains and forests, with abundant 
            wildlife and many small towns. It’s a destination for outdoor activities like skiing, 
            mountain biking and kayaking. Massive Denali National Park is home to Denali (formerly called Mount McKinley), North America’s highest peak.

                Cruise ships ply Alaska’s southern coast, offering whale-watching and views of Glacier Bay National Park. 
                Popular stops include the capital, Juneau and Sitka, with its blend of Russian and Alaska Native history. 
                Seward Highway, a National Scenic Byway, looks out over the Chugach Mountains and the Turnagain Arm waterway. 
                Anchorage, the largest city, has a walkable downtown and sophisticated restaurants, often serving local salmon, 
                halibut and game. Farther north, the gold-rush town of Fairbanks is gateway to the vast interior. 
                The remote Arctic, populated mostly by Native groups, is accessible only by air.
